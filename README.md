## Hi there 💪

I’m [Saad](https://github.com/saadkarim1), a full-stack developer based in Morocco.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering (2024) from SupMTI Rabat.

I love creating modern and user-friendly web applications.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

I am currently working on ProFind, a job finder application to help people find and apply for jobs efficiently.

My main tech stack is Laravel, React.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [ProFind]([https://github.com/saadkarim1](https://github.com/saadkarim1/ProFind))
